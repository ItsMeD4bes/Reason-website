            <h2>Why did I take IT related(CS) course in college</h2>
            <div class="text">
                I chose computer science because of my passion for problem-solving, my dream of creating things that can help others, and the encouragement I received from my teachers. Solving problems brings me both joy and valuable lessons, and I know CS focuses on programming and coding, which matches my interest more than IT, which deals with both hardware and software. I discovered programming when I was in Grade 10, and as a Grade 11 ICT student before, I developed a system that can help my school to process scholarship updates more efficiently and organize student information efficiently. Seeing my work make a real impact gives me the motivation to continue pursuing programming. With the trust and support of my teachers, I got the determination to take computer science seriously because for me now this is not just a subject or a college degree but a career path where I can achieve something meaningful and further develop my knowledge in the field of programming.

                    My dream job is to become a software engineer. I want to create applications or systems that can make people's lives easier and more convenient. I imagine myself building programs that can solve real problems, whether it's for school, business, or even for everyday life. For me, being a software engineer is not only about coding; it's also about using creativity and logic to make something useful for others. This dream connects to my love for programming and problem-solving. Since the first time I learned how to code, I've been amazed by how simple lines of code can turn into a working system that actually helps people. That's why I see this career as both a challenge and a chance to grow. It also makes me excited because technology is always improving, and I want to be part of that progress while learning more along the way. In the future, I hope to be someone who not only develops software but also inspires others to explore technology. I believe that with hard work, continuous learning, and determination, I can reach this dream and make a positive difference.

            <h2>Who am i after ten years</h2>
            <div class="group">
                <div class="text">
                    In the next 10 years I see myself as a professional who has grown because of both achievements and challenges. I know my passion for problem-solving, determination, and ability to adapt will guide me toward to success. The values I've learned, like hard work, patience, and resilience from facing failures and struggles, will help me to handle bigger responsibilities in life and in my career. By that time I picture myself graduating proudly as a Tamaraw from FEU Alabang, carrying with me the knowledge and skills I gained from my computer science journey. I see myself working in the software engineering industry, applying what I learned in school and my experiences to real projects that can make a difference. I also imagine myself not only reaching my own goals but also helping other people through technology and innovation. Overall, I see myself becoming a stronger and wiser version of who I am today, continuing to improve, staying resilient, and keeping faith that the path I chose will lead me to a meaningful and fulfilling future.
